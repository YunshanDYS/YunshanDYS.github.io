Welcome to my homepage! I am an incoming postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University, where I will work under the supervision of Prof. Yanxun Xu. I completed my PhD in Statistics and Data Science at the University of Texas at Austin supervised by Prof. Peter Müller. Prior to UT Austin, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Math from Fudan University in China. 

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in Bayesian non-parametrics, statistical machine learning, and their applications in bioinformatics and clinical trials. Specifically, I am interested in
Methodology:
- Dependent random partitions, model-based clustering
- Gaussian Processes, generalized Bayes
Application:
- Single-cell data and spatial transcriptomics
- Clinical trial design and analysis
